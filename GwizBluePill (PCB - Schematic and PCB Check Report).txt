Checking integrity of Schematic and Pcb designs in project "GwizBluePill"
=========================================================================

The PCB and Schematic designs do not match.
To bring them into line, you will need to make the following changes to the PCB design:


Disconnect Pin IC2-P$21 from Net "GND"
Disconnect Pin IC2-P$22 from Net "GND"
Disconnect Pin IC2-P$23 from Net "VCC_3V3"
Disconnect Pin IC2-P$25 from Net "TESLA_BM_RX"
Disconnect Pin IC2-P$26 from Net "TESLA_BM_TX"
Disconnect Pin IC2-P$33 from Net "SERIAL2_RX"
Disconnect Pin IC2-P$34 from Net "SERIAL2_TX"

Component 'BTS117BKSA1' package 'TO254P440X1000X2110-3P' in PCB is newer version than Schematic, use Update Component to correct this.
Component 'BLUE_PILL_JS' package 'BLUE_PILL' in Schematic is newer version than PCB, use Update Component to correct this.

Value "Arrow Part Number" on component instance "IC4" caused by library item mismatch.

Value "Arrow Price/Stock" on component instance "IC4" caused by library item mismatch.

Use Update to reload Component "BTS117BKSA1" to add/alter Value "Mouser Price/Stock"
Use Update to reload Component "BTS117BKSA1" to add/alter Value "RS Part Number"
Use Update to reload Component "BTS117BKSA1" to add/alter Value "RS Price/Stock"
Connect Pin IC2-P$36 to Net "TESLA_BM_RX"
Connect Pin IC2-P$35 to Net "TESLA_BM_TX"
Connect Pin IC2-P$28 to Net "SERIAL2_RX"
Connect Pin IC2-P$27 to Net "SERIAL2_TX"
Connect Pin IC2-P$39 to Net "GND"
Connect Pin IC2-P$38 to Net "VCC_3V3"
Connect Pin IC2-P$40 to Net "GND"
